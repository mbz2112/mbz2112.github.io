   		<div class="center" style="color: grey; padding-bottom: 30px;">Helping students at Columbia University find research opportunities to assist in their professional development</div> 

	<div style="padding-bottom: 30px;">
		Three other undergraduate students and I worked together to design a user-centric solution to help students explore research opportunities at Columbia University. We decided to focus on students that are interested in pursuing research, either as a career or desire to learn more about a specific topic.  
	</div>

	<div style="padding-bottom: 30px;">
		This project was part of a 2-week design sprint hosted by the student organization, Design @ Columbia, and we were given the following prompt to build from: “Your school wants to help students graduate with a better understanding of their career options and interests. Design an experience that helps students explore opportunities for careers.” 
	</div>

	<h3 style="padding-bottom: 30px;">Research Questions</h3>
	<li>How might we help students interested in research understand expectations (prerequisites, work culture, funding or credit, work culture, etc.) and learning trajectories for each research position? </li>
	<li style="padding-bottom: 50px;">How might we build a community to help prospective research students connect with current student researchers?</li>

	<h3 style="padding-bottom: 30px;">Competitor Analysis</h3>
	<div style="padding-bottom: 30px;">At this time, we were not aware of any centralized resources that students could use to explore research opportunities besides the Columbia University and Barnard College research websites. We started our research by exploring potential competitors, more specifically, what platforms Columbia and Barnard students currently use to explore research opportunities, learn about potential professors to conduct research with, and find related jobs. We decided to assess the five competitors we established based on the following criteria: communication style, layout, features/function, content/information, accessibility, target user group, and potential to build community. The following are screenshots of the Competitor Analysis tables we created. 
	</div>
	
	<div class="row" style="padding-bottom: 50px">
		<div class="col-md-6">
			<img src="CompetitorAnalysis1.jpeg" alt="Competitor Analysis 1" width="100%"/>
		</div>
		<div class="col-md-6">
			<img src="CompetitorAnalysis2.jpeg" alt="Competitor Analysis 2" width="100%"/> 
		</div>
	</div>
	
		<h3 style="padding-bottom: 30px;">Interviews</h3>
	<div style="padding-bottom: 30px;">
		To better understand our user’s needs and goals, we conducted interviews with undergraduate students at Columbia University who are interested in exploring research opportunities. The main concerns are expressed in the following quotes: 
	</div>

	<div class="row" style="padding-bottom: 30px;">
	<div class="col-md-4">
	<blockquote class="block block_bordered">
		<p class="block_text">
			“I wish I could have entered a lab earlier, maybe there should be a better way to apply, instead of attending the [Computer Science] Research Fair and emailing professors.” 
		</p>
	</blockquote>
	</div>

		<div class="col-md-4">
	<blockquote class="block block_bordered">
		<p class="block_text">
			“The harder part [of finding research] was going through the process of getting all the paperwork ready, actually finding the internship I was interested in, but at the same time covered my skill sets.” 
		</p>
	</blockquote>
	</div>

	<div class="col-md-4">
	<blockquote class="block block_bordered">
		<p class="block_text">
			“My interaction with undergraduates interested in research is limited...so maybe something that would be cool would be to have an opportunity to connect with people outside the program.” 
		</p>
	</blockquote>
	</div>
	</div>

	<div style="padding-bottom: 30px;">Based on our interviews, we divided the concerns into three main categories to futher explore</div>

	<ol>
		<li>Finding research opportunities</li>
		<li>Connecting with others doing research</li>
		<li style="padding-bottom: 50px;">Finding jobs that are compatible with their skill set</li>
	</ol>

	<h3 style="padding-bottom: 30px;">Research Synthesis</h3>
	<div style="padding-bottom: 30px;">Based on our interview data, we created personas to summarize and better understand our user’s end goals. In the following personas, we included the user’s goals, motivations and frustrations that can be used to help drive our system design.</div>

	<div class="row" style="padding-bottom: 30px;">
		<div class="col-md-4">
			<img src="Persona1.jpeg" alt="Persona 1" width="100%"/>
		</div>
		<div class="col-md-4">
			<img src="Persona2.jpeg" alt="Persona 2" width="100%"/> 
		</div>
		<div class="col-md-4">
			<img src="Persona3.jpeg" alt="Persona 3" width="100%"/>
		</div>
	</div>

	<div style="padding-bottom: 30px;">In addition, I collaborated with another team member on a journey map, where we mapped out various experiences and emotions users have along the way, as well as opportunities to proceed with based on the challenges at each stage.</div>

	<div class="row" style="padding-bottom: 50px;"> 
		<div class="col-md-12">
			<img src="JourneyMap.jpeg" alt="Journey Map" width="100%">
		</div>
	</div>

	<h3 style="padding-bottom: 30px;">Prototyping</h3>
	<div style="padding-bottom: 30px;">Based on the qualitative data collected from the interviews and summarized in the user personas, as well as the journey map with various opportunities to build from, we each sketched potential solutions. We did an exercise called “Crazy 8’s,” which is an excellent brainstorming exercise that requires each person to sketch 8 unique ideas in 8 minutes. After presenting our “Crazy 8’s” to each other, we discussed what we wanted to bring to our solution sketches. Based on these rough sketches, I collaborated with another team member on a low fidelity prototype of an app students looking for research opportunities could use. The main functions of the app are outlined as follows: </div>

	<li>Explore and learn about the various research labs on campus</li>
	<li>Have access to reviews from previous and current student researchers</li>
	<li>Reach out to student researchers to build community</li>
	<li>Receive customized recommendations about research opportunities</li>
	<li style="padding-bottom: 30px;">Find the most up to date postings</li>

	<div style="padding-bottom: 30px;">The following low fidelity prototypes were created in Figma in collaboration with my other team members.</div>

	<a href="https://www.figma.com/proto/kbjXPCHVTczwJjIsk47pUp/D-C-Weekend-Design-Sprint-1-MSSJ?node-id=591%3A1566&scaling=scale-down">Figma Prototype</a>

		<div class="col-md-12">
			<img src="LowFiPrototype2.jpeg" alt="Low Fidelity Prototype 2" width="100%">
		</div>
	</div>

	<h3 style="padding-bottom: 30px;">User Testing</h3>
	<div style="padding-bottom: 30px;">After creating a low-fidelity prototype, the next step was to test it out on our target users, students looking for research opportunities, in order to ensure it is easy to navigate, user friendly, and addresses their goals. Each team member conducted one user test, so we had a total of four user tests.</div>

	<div style="padding-bottom: 30px;">In preparation for our user tests, we created a series of user stories to help us understand what value each page in our prototype could have for our end users. The table below consists of a series of user stories, corresponding with specific pages or features. This helped us think about what action this page helps the user accomplish and what it helps them accomplish.</div>

	<div class="row" style="padding-bottom: 30px;"> 
		<div class="col-md-12">
			<img src="UserStory.jpeg" alt="User Story" width="100%">
		</div>
	</div>

	<div style="padding-bottom: 30px;">Using the tables above as inspiration, we consolidated our user stories into six main categories, which we used as a guide for when we conducted user tests. The left column consists of the user stories and the right column consists of observations corresponding to each participant (P1, P2, P3, P4), mainly noting whether this feature allowed them to accomplish the goal in the user story and what they found confusing if anything.</div>

	<div class="row" style="padding-bottom: 30px;">
		<div class="col-md-12">
			<img src="UserStory1.jpeg" alt="User Story 1" width="100%">
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="row" style="padding-bottom: 30px;">
		<div class="col-md-12">
			<img src="UserStory2.jpeg" alt="User Story 2" width="100%">
		</div>
	</div>

	<div style="padding-bottom: 30px;">Based on our user tests, we constructed a heat map to consolidate our findings and better understand where our user’s needs are met and where our system design is lacking. The heat map also provides a more visual way to synthesize our findings and understand how important each user story is to our target users. One example is that the heat map shows that 75% of our users are not interested in the first user story: “I want to gain foresight of doing research in academia so that I know what I should prepare in order to pursue this path.” Instead, they are more interested in the user story, “I want to hear about insider insights of a lab so that I can decide if this lab is the best fit.” Thus, the heat map helped us see that our users were more interested in hearing reviews from peers about labs and research experiences than learning how to pursue research as a career path, such as in academia. Knowing this helped us tweak our original prototype to focus more on building community and allowing users to read reviews from others (more like Yelp for reviewing restaurants or Rate My Professor for reviewing college professors). In summary, this heat map helped us gain insight on what aspects to focus on going forward.</div>

	<div class="row" style="padding-bottom: 50px;"> 
		<div class="col-md-12">
			<img src="HeatMap.jpeg" alt="Heat Map" width="100%">
		</div>
	</div>

	<h3 style="padding-bottom: 30px;">High-Fidelity Prototype</h3>
	
	<div style="padding-bottom: 30px;">Based on our user tests, we were able to discuss ways to modify our low-fidelity prototype to better meet the needs of our end users. The modifications we decided to make are summarized as follows:</div>
	<li>Simplify prototype - our original design was not the most usable as users were confused how to navigate through pages of the app</li>
	<li style="padding-bottom: 30px;">Redesign and reorganize the toolbar at the bottom of the page - we reduced our design to three icons instead of six to allow for simpler navigation</li>

	<div style="padding-bottom: 30px">Our design consists of three main features summarized as follows</div>
	<li>Home: recommendations of potential labs, reviews organized by department, and a search icon to take the user to a new page.</li>
	<li>Chat: allows users to reach out to those who have written reviews and make connections with other student researchers.</li>
	<li style="padding-bottom: 30px;">Me: profile page that covers the user's basic information and activity, including a survey they can fill out for customization, labs they marked as their favorites, and reviews they wrote</li>

	<div style="padding-bottom: 30px;">We built our high-fidelity prototype on Figma and included screenshots and a link that allows you to click through the prototype below.</div>

	<h3 style="padding-bottom: 30px;">Conclusion + Recap</h3>
	
	<div style="padding-bottom: 30px;">Throughout this 2-week Design Sprint, my team members and I were able to produce 
		a high-fidelity, clickable Figma prototype of an app students could use to explore and learn more about available 
		research opportunities. From two simple How Might We Questions, preliminary research in the form of competitor 
		analysis research and interviews with potential users, research synthesis in the form of personas and a journey map, 
		user tests completed with a low-fidelity prototype and guiding user stories, we were able to create a clickable high-fidelity 
		prototype of an app design that we presented at the end of the Design Sprint.</div>    

	<h3 style="padding-bottom: 30px;">Future Work</h3>
	
	<div style="padding-bottom: 50px;">Given more time, we could have conducted interviews with more users rather than just four. 
		Conducting more interviews would give us a better idea of the needs of our target users and provide us with more 
		content to identify patterns of needs and goals from. Similarly, it could be worth conducting more user tests to 
		better understand what people have difficulty with. Future work could look at the user interface design of the 
		app in order to make it more accessible, user friendly, and visually appealing. </div>
	
	<h3 style="padding-bottom: 30px;">Reflections + Takeaways</h3>
	<div style="padding-bottom: 30px;">This project was my first introduction to the world of design.
	I completed this project in the summer of 2020 in the midst of the global pandemic. 
	As I was home taking classes online, I was lucky enough to stumble across Design @ Columbia,
	a student organization for those interested in pursuing UI/UX design or related fields, who happened 
	to be hosting a 2-week design sprint over the summer. From engaging in this project, I learned by doing. 
	From conducting user interviews to user tests, I learned about the design process and the importance of 
	designing products that put the user first - a message our team mentor (one of the club founders) helped instill in us.</div>
	
	<div style="padding-bottom: 30px;">I learned that I thrive in teams. I really enjoyed collaborating with a team of students 
		I had never met before, as we utilized our varied strengths and interests to produce something I feel very proud of. 
		I also learned my strengths in committing to a project from its inception to its completion and ensuring deadlines 
		were met throughout the sprint.</div>
	<div style="padding-bottom: 30px;">I loved learning about the design process and felt that the tight time window of 2-weeks 
		actually pushed us to produce results we may not have reached without that level of focus. Although it was relatively 
		new to me, I felt that I could leverage the skills I developed from my Computer Science and Sociology majors, 
		such as basic knowledge of design principles and interviewing skills, for this project. Working on this project 
		encouraged me to enroll in some design-related classes in college, where I got to work on more projects of this nature.</div>
