   		<div class="center" style="color: grey;">Helping students at Columbia University find research opportunities to assist in their professional development</div> 
	</div>

	<div style="padding-bottom: 10px;">
		Three other undergraduate students and I worked together to design a user-centric solution to help students explore research opportunities at Columbia University. We decided to focus on students that are interested in pursuing research, either as a career or desire to learn more about a specific topic.  
	</div>

	<div style="padding-bottom: 30px;">
		This project was part of a 2-week design sprint hosted by the student organization, Design @ Columbia, and we were given the following prompt to build from: “Your school wants to help students graduate with a better understanding of their career options and interests. Design an experience that helps students explore opportunities for careers.” 
	</div>

	<h3 style="padding-bottom: 10px;">Research Questions</h3>
	<li>How might we help students interested in research understand expectations (prerequisites, work culture, funding or credit, work culture, etc.) and learning trajectories for each research position? </li>
	<li style="padding-bottom: 30px;">How might we build a community to help prospective research students connect with current student researchers?</li>

	<h3 style="padding-bottom: 10px;">Competitor Analysis</h3>
	<div style="padding-bottom: 30px;">At this time, we were not aware of any centralized resources that students could use to explore research opportunities besides the Columbia University and Barnard College research websites. We started our research by exploring potential competitors, more specifically, what platforms Columbia and Barnard students currently use to explore research opportunities, learn about potential professors to conduct research with, and find related jobs. We decided to assess the five competitors we established based on the following criteria: communication style, layout, features/function, content/information, accessibility, target user group, and potential to build community. The following are screenshots of the Competitor Analysis tables we created.
